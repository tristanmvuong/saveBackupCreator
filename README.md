# saveBackupCreator

When playing video games on my computer, occassionally I would be playing a game that only had a single save file. Unfortunately, this creates a situation where it is possible for the game to crash during saving and corrupt the save file, thus causing a total loss of progress. To combat this, I would from time to time manually create a copy of the save file. One day, however, it occurred to me that I could automate the copying part.

## Setting Up

The program just needs to be built as a standalone executable. Can be done in Visual Studio.

## Using it

Launch the application and from there the form appears. The location of the save files need to be given and the frequency of the copying of the latest save need to be set, but after that a simple click is enough to start the copying.
