# saveBackupCreator

When playing video games on my computer, occassionally I would be playing a game that only had a single save file. Unfortunately, this creates a situation where it is possible for the game to crash during saving and corrupt the save file, thus causing a total loss of progress. To combat this, I would from time to time manually create a copy of the save file. One day, however, it occurred to me that I could automate the copying part.
